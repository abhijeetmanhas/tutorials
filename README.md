# Notebook Tutorials for Deep Learning in Astronomy

This repository contains tutorials with examples on how to use [MiraPy](https://github.com/mirapy-org/mirapy) for Deep Learning in Astronomy. We look forward to seeing your contributions to the MiraPy organisation. :smile:

## Available Notebooks

Following are the tutorials on using MiraPy:

- Astronomical Image Reconstruction using Autoencoder
- Classification of variable stars in ATLAS catalog
- X-Ray Binary Classification
- HTRU1 Pulsar Dataset Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network
- [Playing with Sunspotter Dataset (Regression models, feature reduction, unsupervised clustering and visualization)](https://github.com/swapsha96/socis/blob/master/Playing%20with%20Sunspotter%20Dataset.ipynb)

Notebooks for the following will be added soon:

- Classification of different states of GRS1905+105 X-Ray Binaries using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- OGLE Catalog of Variable Stars - Classification of Light curves (RNN)

This repository will updated with more Jupyter notebooks soon. You can find the main repository of MiraPy package [here](https://github.com/mirapy-org/mirapy).
