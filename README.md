# Notebook Tutorials for Deep Learning in Astronomy

This repository contains tutorials with examples on how to use [MiraPy](https://github.com/mirapy-org/mirapy) for Deep Learning in Astronomy. We look forward to seeing your contributions to the MiraPy organisation. :smile:

## Available Notebooks

Following are the tutorials on using MiraPy:

- Astronomical Image Reconstruction using Autoencoder ([Dataset](https://github.com/mirapy-org/messier-catalog-images/tree/master/data))
- Classification of variable stars in ATLAS catalog (FCN) ([Source](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/atlas-var/))
- OGLE Catalog of Variable Stars - Classification of Light curves (RNN) ([Source](http://ogledb.astrouw.edu.pl/~ogle/OCVS/))
- X-Ray Binary Classification ([Dataset](https://github.com/mirapy-org/mirapy/tree/master/mirapy/dataset/XRayBinary))
- HTRU1 Pulsar Dataset Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network ([Dataset](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/research/ascaife/htru1-batches-py.tar.gz))
- Playing with Sunspotter Dataset ([Dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/1478966))

Notebooks for the following will be added soon:

- Classification of different states of GRS1905+105 X-Ray Binaries using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

This repository will updated with more Jupyter notebooks soon. You can find the main repository of MiraPy package [here](https://github.com/mirapy-org/mirapy).
